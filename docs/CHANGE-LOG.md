  - `keywords.csv` (created — 28 keywords across 4 categories)
  - `src/__init__.py` (created — package init)
  - `src/main.py` (created — entry point, orchestration, timestamp management)

### 2026-05-09 | [Initialization & Scope Definition]

- **Files**:
  - `docs/SCOPE.md` (created — requirements baseline)
  - `docs/SCOPE.md` (polished — fixed typos, restructured, added technical details)
  - `docs/SCOPE.md` (updated — locked Python 3.11+ as runtime)
  - `AGENTS.md` (created — workflow rules, context loading, token budgets, AI directives)
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (created — system topology, tech stack, deployment, data model)
  - `docs/CONTEXT-MAP.md` (created — module mappings, file responsibilities)
  - `docs/CHANGE-LOG.md` (created — this file)
  - `docs/DB-SCHEMA.md` (created — no database for this project)
  - `docs/PLAN.md` (created — phased implementation roadmap)
- **Decisions**:
  - Python 3.11+ selected over Node.js (better fit for GitHub Actions + RSS parsing)
  - No AI/LLM integration needed (keyword matching is sufficient)
  - Filter scope: RSS title + description only (no full URL scraping)
  - No database (stateless execution with artifact-based deduplication)
- **Validation**: docs/ structure ✅ | Scope defined ✅ | Plan aligned ✅
- **Risk**: Low | **Rollback**: Delete all docs/* files except SCOPE.md
